This repository contains the theory files for the paper `Contextuality in distributed systems'

Notable proofs include -
The proof that maximal covers are closed under antichain meet and join, located in Topological_Spaces.thy (max_cover_closed_meet && max_cover_closed_join) 

The proof of theorem 2 (that Chaos forms a tuple system) can be found at the bottom of Information_Algebras.thy

Example 1 is formalised in Example.thy

Proofs currently build in release candidate 2 for [Isabelle 2022](https://isabelle.sketis.net/website-Isabelle2022-RC2/), other versions untested.
